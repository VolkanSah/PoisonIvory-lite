### Advanced Security & Threat Monitoring (DIY)

> [!WARNING]
> Professional Use Only - Handle With Extreme Care!
> This tool is designed for **experienced security professionals and red/blue teams**. It provides a battle-tested (mini)framework for infrastructure hardening, threat detection, and offensive security research.
> **PoisonIvory is not for script kiddies!** It intentionally requires deep technical knowledge to operate effectively. Expect to troubleshoot missing dependencies, analyze raw outputs, and interpret security events.


## What is PoisonIvory?

PoisonIvory is an elite security operations (micro) framework/boilerplate that combines a range of capabilities to conduct deep security audits and provide continuous threat monitoring within an authorized environment.

## Usage

### Command Structure (Preserved Original Interface)

```bash
PoisonIvory.py [COMMAND] <config_file>
```

### Operations

| Command | Function |
|---|---|
| `scan` | Run full security audit (port scanning and vulnerability assessment). |
| `monitor` | Start continuous monitoring of network traffic and system health. |
| `create-config`| Generate default configuration file. |

### Nuclear Mode Activation

Enable `nuclear_mode` in your configuration file for high-intensity operations. When enabled, PoisonIvory will:

  - Increase network buffer sizes (requires root).
  - Use aggressive scanning parameters (`-T5 --min-rate 5000`).
  - Allocate additional system resources.
  - Reduce monitoring intervals.

Example warning at startup:

```text
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
!! NUCLEAR MODE ACTIVATED - EXPECT SYSTEM INSTABILITY !!
!!    Target servers may experience disruption       !!
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
```

### Examples

**Run security audit:**

```bash
PoisonIvory.py scan config.json
```

**Start continuous monitoring:**

```bash
PoisonIvory.py monitor config.json
```

-----

## Design Philosophy

PoisonIvory embodies three core principles:

1.  **Expert-Centric**

      - No GUIs, no hand-holding, no "easy mode".
      - Raw terminal output and JSON reports only.
      - Errors are learning opportunities, not bugs to be automatically fixed.

2.  **Original Architecture Preserved**

      - Nuclear Fusion Edition maintains Volkan's original code structure.
      - Critical security fixes integrated without over-engineering.
      - Seamless upgrade path for existing users.

3.  **Offense-Informed Defense**

      - Adversary-emulating techniques for robust defense development.
      - Threshold-based automatic countermeasures.
      - Tor circuit warfare capabilities with anti-loop protection.

###  PoisonIvory Statement: Nemesis Fusion Philosophy

### I. The Duality of the Blade

PoisonIvory is neither shield nor sword alone — it is tempered steel. In today's cybersphere, the divide between defense (Blue) and offense (Red/Black) is shaped by context, not by tools. Ivory exists in the grey zone: defending the weak and exposing the reckless.

### II. Camouflage Through Integrity

Truly powerful tools don't need loud names. PoisonIvory hides as what systems crave most: a vigilant monitor. This mimicry isn't for malice — it demonstrates that trust in digital infrastructure must be earned through verification, not granted by a harmless process name.

### III. The Nuclear Option: Controlled Escalation

When diplomacy fails and perimeters collapse, Ivory enters Nuclear Fusion mode.

* The kernel is tuned for transparency, not destruction.
* Speed is used to outrun the shadows.
* Anyone invoking this mode accepts full responsibility for the instability born from illuminating truth inside a compromised system.

### IV. Reflexive Autonomy (The Missing Piece)

Defense must move at the speed of light, not the speed of man. Ivory is designed to react reflexively—an automated immune response to digital pathogens. It does not wait for permission to survive; it scales its aggression based on the threat it observes.

### V. The Tor Paradox

We use anonymity to increase accountability. By rotating identities, Ivory evades automated tracking by the adversary, buying the human operator the most precious resource in a crisis: **Time.**

### VI. The Final Instance (Forensic Resistance)

A tool that sees everything must leave no trace that could be weaponized against the innocent. PoisonIvory is gas—filling the void, scanning every corner, and vanishing upon contact, taking its secrets to the grave.


> **"In the fusion of offense and defense lies the only true security."**
